# PHYS200 Basics of Scientific Computation

*PHYS200 Basics of Scientific Computation* is an undergraduate Physics course offered to sophomore students at Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey.

## Projects Overview

This repository contains the projects I worked on during the Fall semester of the 2023â€“2024 academic year. Python is extensively used in the projects to perform various scientific computations and visualizations.

### Project 1: Graphene Sheet Generation

The project involves a script that generates a graphene sheet using Matplotlib. The dimensions of the horizontal and vertical axes are user-specified. The script also creates a `coordinates.txt` file that contains the coordinates of each atom in the sheet.

### Project 2: Black-Body Radiation Visualization

The project is a script that visualizes Planck's law of black-body radiation. It uses a user-defined `linspace` function to generate a range of frequencies and then calculates the corresponding spectral radiance for each frequency. The script also calculates the area under the graph using Simpson's rule for numerical integration. The results are then plotted using Matplotlib, providing a visual representation of the black-body radiation spectrum for a given temperature `T`.

### Project 3: Pi Approximation using the Monte Carlo Method

The project is a script that approximates the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method. It generates a user-specified number of random points in a unit square and determines whether each point falls within a quarter-circle. The ratio of points within the circle to the total number of points approximates Pi/4. The script also calculates the percentage error of the approximation as the number of points increases. The results are visualized using Matplotlib, with one plot showing the points and the quarter-circle, and another plot showing the percentage error as a function of the number of points.

### Project 4: Taylor Expansion

The project consists of a script that calculates the exponential of a random float number using the Taylor series expansion. The number of terms in the expansion is user-specified. The script includes functions to calculate the factorial of a number and to generate a list of evenly spaced numbers over a specified interval. This project is a great example of using Python for numerical computations and approximations.
